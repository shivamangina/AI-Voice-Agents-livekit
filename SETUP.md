# 🚀 Customer Support Agent Swarm - Setup Guide

## What This Project Does

This is a **Customer Support Agent Swarm** system that demonstrates:

1. **5 AI Agents Working Together**: Transcriber, Sentiment, Intent, Compliance, and Sales agents
2. **Real-time Orchestration**: Agents analyze customer conversations simultaneously
3. **Blockchain Integration**: Critical events are logged on Ethereum Sepolia via Chainlink
4. **Live Dashboard**: Beautiful UI showing agent collaboration and blockchain events

## 🎯 Quick Start (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
```bash
# Install pnpm if you don't have it
npm install -g pnpm

# Install project dependencies
pnpm install
```

### Step 2: Start the Demo
```bash
# Start the development server
pnpm dev
```

### Step 3: Open the Demo
Visit: `http://localhost:3000/demo`

That's it! You now have a working demo of the Customer Support Agent Swarm.

## 🎮 How to Use the Demo

### 1. Start a Call
- Click "🎯 Start Customer Support Call"
- Watch the blockchain event appear
- All 5 agents become active

### 2. Simulate Conversation
- Type messages as a customer (e.g., "I'm having trouble logging in")
- Click "🤖 Simulate Agent Response" to see agent replies
- Watch real-time agent analysis appear

### 3. Monitor the Agents
- **Transcriber** 💬: Processes all conversation
- **Sentiment** 📊: Analyzes emotional tone
- **Intent** 🎯: Classifies customer goals
- **Compliance** 🛡️: Checks for violations
- **Sales** 💰: Identifies upsell opportunities

### 4. Blockchain Integration
- Sales opportunities are automatically logged on-chain
- Compliance events are recorded
- All events show block numbers and timestamps

## 🏗️ Full Setup (For Development)

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- pnpm
- Ethereum wallet with Sepolia ETH (for blockchain features)

### Step 1: Environment Setup
```bash
# Copy environment template
cp env.example .env.local

# Edit .env.local with your API keys
nano .env.local
```

**Required Environment Variables:**
```env
# AI Services (optional for demo)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key

# Blockchain (optional for demo)
SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/YOUR_PROJECT_ID
PRIVATE_KEY=your_wallet_private_key
```
 

### Step 3: ElizaOS Setup (Optional)

## 🎯 Demo Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Technical Support
1. Start call
2. Customer: "I can't log into my account"
3. Watch agents analyze:
   - Sentiment: "Customer frustrated"
   - Intent: "Technical support needed"
   - Compliance: "No issues"
   - Sales: "Premium support opportunity"

### Scenario 2: Billing Issue
1. Start call
2. Customer: "I was charged twice this month"
3. Watch agents analyze:
   - Sentiment: "Customer angry"
   - Intent: "Billing dispute"
   - Compliance: "Financial regulation check"
   - Sales: "Retention opportunity"

### Scenario 3: Product Inquiry
1. Start call
2. Customer: "What features does the premium plan include?"
3. Watch agents analyze:
   - Sentiment: "Customer interested"
   - Intent: "Product inquiry"
   - Compliance: "No issues"
   - Sales: "High-value opportunity"

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. "Module not found" errors**
```bash
# Clear cache and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules pnpm-lock.yaml
pnpm install
```

**2. Port 3000 already in use**
```bash
# Use different port
pnpm dev --port 3001
```

**3. TypeScript errors**
```bash
# These are just warnings, the demo still works
# For production, add proper type definitions
```

### Getting Help

1. **Demo not working**: Check browser console for errors
2. **Agents not responding**: Check network tab for API calls
3. **Blockchain events not showing**: This is simulated in the demo
