# 🎯 Customer Support Agent Swarm - Demo Guide

## 🚀 **PROJECT IS NOW WORKING!**

Your Customer Support Agent Swarm is ready to demo for the Chromion Chainlink Hackathon!

## 📋 **What This Project Does**

This is a **real-time multi-agent orchestration system** that demonstrates:

### 🤖 **5 AI Agents Working Together**
1. **Transcriber Agent** 💬 - Processes conversation in real-time
2. **Sentiment Agent** 📊 - Analyzes emotional tone and frustration levels
3. **Intent Agent** 🎯 - Classifies customer goals and urgency
4. **Compliance Agent** 🛡️ - Monitors for regulatory violations
5. **Sales Agent** 💰 - Identifies upsell opportunities

### ⛓️ **Blockchain Integration**
- **Chainlink Integration**: Critical events logged on Ethereum Sepolia
- **Smart Contracts**: Compliance flags and sales opportunities recorded on-chain
- **Transparent Audit Trail**: All support interactions permanently stored

### 🎨 **Beautiful Live Dashboard**
- Real-time agent collaboration visualization
- Interactive conversation simulation
- Blockchain event tracking
- Professional UI with real-time updates

## 🎮 **How to Run the Demo**

### **Step 1: Start the Application**
```bash

- **Transparent audit trail** for all interactions
- **Chainlink VRF** for agent decision randomness

### **3. Production-Ready Demo**
- **Beautiful, responsive UI** with real-time updates
- **Interactive conversation simulation**
- **Live blockchain event display**
- **Professional dashboard** showing agent collaboration

### **4. Real-World Impact**
- **Solves actual customer support challenges**
- **Compliance automation** for regulatory requirements
- **Revenue optimization** through sales intelligence
- **Quality improvement** through sentiment analysis

## 🎯 **Demo Script for Judges**

### **Opening (30 seconds)**
*"This is a Customer Support Agent Swarm that uses 5 AI agents to assist human support agents in real-time. Each agent has a specialized role, and they work together to provide comprehensive support while logging critical events on the blockchain for transparency."*

### **Live Demo (2 minutes)**
1. **Show the Dashboard**: *"Here's our live dashboard showing all 5 agents active and ready"*
2. **Start a Call**: *"Let me start a customer support call"* (click button)
3. **Simulate Conversation**: *"Now I'll simulate a frustrated customer"* (type message)
4. **Show Agent Analysis**: *"Watch how each agent analyzes the conversation in real-time"*
5. **Highlight Blockchain**: *"Notice how sales opportunities are automatically logged on-chain"*

### **Technical Highlights (1 minute)**
- **ElizaOS**: *"We use ElizaOS for sophisticated agent orchestration"*
- **Chainlink**: *"Chainlink provides the blockchain integration for transparency"*
- **Real-time**: *"All analysis happens in real-time with sub-second response"*
- **Extensible**: *"The architecture makes it easy to add new agents"*

### **Closing (30 seconds)**
*"This demonstrates the future of customer support - where AI agents work together to provide better service while maintaining complete transparency through blockchain technology."*

## 🔧 **Technical Architecture**

### **Frontend**
- **Next.js 15** with TypeScript
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Real-time updates** with React state management
